This branch only works if you have the following things:

- Motorola MTM5x00, MTM800E, MTM800FuG
- active data cable, e.g. PMKN4104
- (Sepura/Cleartone my work, but no warranty)

The MS is completely controlled by AT-commands over the PEI interface

Installation instructions from Frédéric/F1IWQ can be found here:
https://github.com/f1iwq2/Tetra_Link_boardIWQ/blob/main/Doc/Download%20svxlink-tetra.pdf

Here are two quick-and-dirty installation/update documentation, keep 
in mind: No configuration will be done!

1) first time installation (including German(!) voice announcements):

You may use my semi-automatic installation-script from here 
http://svxlink.ham-radio-op.net/svxlink/svxlink-tetra-contrib.sh

Start installation as root:
wget -O - http://svxlink.ham-radio-op.net/svxlink/svxlink-tetra-contrib.sh | bash


2) Update an existing tetra-contrib installation made by the previous script 
as root:

systemctl stop svxlink
cd /home/svxlink/svxlink/src/build/
git pull
make install
systemctl start svxlink
